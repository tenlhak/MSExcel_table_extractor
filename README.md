# 📊 MS Excel Table Extractor

In the age of AI agents, one of the key frontiers a truly agentic model must overcome is: **identifying tables in MS Excel spreadsheets and extracting relevant data for downstream processing.** 🚀

This project represents the **initial stage of that pipeline.** It's a deep learning model designed to detect tables within Excel files. The architecture is heavily inspired by Microsoft's paper:

The **training data** is the exact same dataset used in the paper, available here:
